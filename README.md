# Learning Path

This repo is just designed to be a place where you can view my current learning path

## The order of things

The order of the things that I learnt does not really matter that much. This is just my journey and what I feel I need to work on.

## What is covered

It is a mixed bag, I am right now mainly focusing on

- React and most popular plugins etc
- Gatsby
- Serverless
- Design systems
- Personal projects to practice skills learnt
- General dev stuff in conference videos

I use this "learning path" to just stay up to date with all the changes which is why there is no need to do it in order. I cover many things from detailed courses to just "look at netlify"

## So why the repo then?

It is more for me so I do not loose track of the links, resources and things I take note of as I learn but also for anyone else who may find value in the things I have found out there.

## How to use it

Many of the learning courses are done on [Front end Masters](http://frontendmasters.com). I would really advise getting an account there if you want to stay up to date with all things in the front end world.

The diagram is made using draw.io but you can get a plugin to even open it in VS code if you would like

The list of the things I have done contains the tasks I did, the topic that I covered and some links so they should be self explanatory.
